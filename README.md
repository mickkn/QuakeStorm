Quakeworld mod - STORM

This is my little project to make a MOD for Quakeworld, with gameplay like Shootmania's STORM. 

The main idea.

1. Make a map for the mod
2. Make rockets act like shootmania. Deffenders weapon
    - 3 rockets can be fired and then a "reload" delay
    - No splashdamage, only direct hits count
    - And no push back on enemies, (I think it should be possible to rocketjump)
    - Maybe slower velocity
3. Make railgun the attackers weapon
    - 1 rail at a time with reload time
4. Objective
  - 1v3 match
  - the attacker rotates so anyone will be the attacker
  - after some time the "flag" can be captured and you win
  - rail kills on impact
  - rockets take lives or kills on impact
  - if attacker dies the defenders win
  - if attacker captures (takes a time to capture the flag) he wins
  - if all defenders dies, the attacker still have to capture the flag
5. Some rules for scoring
